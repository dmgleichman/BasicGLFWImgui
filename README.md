# Fork of BasicGLFWImgui

This project is from:

   https://github.com/gwerners/BasicGLFWImgui

I have added an eclipse makefile project and turned on debug.


## BasicGLFWImgui
Basic example of using GLFW + Imgui

I did the same code as the example inside this wonderfull tutorial:

   https://learnopengl.com/#!Getting-started/Camera

Dependencies:

   imgui - amazing gui library - https://github.com/ocornut/imgui

   glfw  - integration with opengl - https://github.com/glfw/glfw

   stb   - amazing code in public domain - https://github.com/nothings/stb


I just added a simple Imgui window so this can be a base project for studing opengl, imgui or glfw without much trouble. I also include the glfw code if someone need to rebuild the glfw library since I don't know how to add the github and make the cmake do it's magic for building it... :-D

I'll add more examples in the future.
